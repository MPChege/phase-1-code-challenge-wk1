## DESCRIPTION
#### Student Grade Generator
It asks the user to enter their students' grades. The input range should be 0 to 100. then print the accurate grade: A > 79, B > 60, C > 59, D > 40, E > 40, and F 79
#### Speed-Detector 
A program that accepts an input of a car's speed, such as 80. It prints "Ok" if the speed is less than 70. Otherwise, it awards the driver one demerit point for every 5 km/h over the posted speed limit (70) and prints the overall number of demerit points. For instance, it prints "Points: 2" if the speed is 80. The function outputs "License suspended" if the motorist receives more than 12 points.
#### Net-Salary Calculator 
A software whose main function is to compute a person's net salary using their base pay and benefits as inputs. calculates the payee's gross salary, net salary, NHIF deductions, and NSSF deductions. The basic pay and total perks are two parameters that the program takes into account.
